Version 0.4.0, "Desperation Attack" (2013-11-30)
================================================

Major changes:

* Boot screen
* Critical hits.
    * Each attack has a 5% chance of knocking an opponent off balance.
    * The next attack against an off balance opponent is an automatic critical hit. In addition to dealing bonus damage, critical hits allow you to execute weapon-specific maneuvers, such as a staff sweep or spinning halberd attack.
* Desperation attacks. When reduced to 30% health or lower, your next attack is an automatic critical hit.
* Changes to Off-Hand Attack make learning left hand techniques easier:
    * Staffs are now classified as double weapons and so can be used with Off-Hand Attack.  (Currently, double weapons _only_ help with Off-Hand Attack; rumors exist of fighting styles that take full advantage of double weapons, but such techniques cannot be found this early in the dungeon...)
    * Off-Hand Attack's tooltip now gives more information, to help you know whether or not it can deal the finishing blow.

Less visible changes:

* Rebalance health, damage, and armor.
* Various tweaks to techniques:
    * Blood Sip heals on hit as well as on each turn.
    * You can now step past unconscious opponents who you've chosen not to kill.
    * Pickpocketing an unconscious creature always succeeds.
    * Creatures who've regained consciousness are still groggy and unable to act for one turn.
    * Poisoned Dart's poison is more dangerous.
    * Charged Bolt is more accurate.
    * Increase damage on Explosive Tags.
* Various tweaks to creatures.  In particular:
    * Fire ants are rarer.
    * Cave bats know Blood Sip.

Version 0.3.0, "A Warrior's Tools" (2013-11-18)
===============================================

* New items: meditation scrolls, scrolls of body hardening, smoke bombs, and explosive tags. Explosive tags are particularly fun to play with.
* AI fixes: dog-head men no longer shoot each other in the back, fire ants no longer try to slash you from across the room, and so on.
* Various other improvements, such as a random name generator and updated particle effects
* Compatible with T-Engine 1.0.5

Version 0.2.0 (2013-10-12)
==========================

* 3 new monsters to fight
* New monsters mean new qi techniques to absorb. Pursue happiness and good fortune with the Five Blessings, lurk in the shadows with Dweller in Darkness and Bat-Blind Vision, amass a swarm of insect allies with Hive Mind, and more.
* New game mechanics: Blindsense and blind-fighting now exist. (They're currently only useful when it's dark; blindness itself is coming in a future version.) You can pickpocket your enemies. There's now a limit to how many qi techniques you can know at once, so absorbing a new technique may require that you forget an old one.
* Various gameplay and UI improvements. For example, the game now tracks all techniques you've learned across any character, so you can right-click an enemy and choose Inspect Creature to see what techniques can be absorbed and which techniques you haven't seen yet.

Version 0.1.0 (2013-09-12)
==========================

Initial beta. It's small (2 basic monster types, 3 dungeon levels) but playable.
