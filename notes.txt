To do NOW:
Kick and bash need animation
Need a way to view passive talents

To do:
Fully implement absorbing abilities
Order default hotkeys better
Random name generator
Right-click menu
Quick switch weapons (probably - binding qi to multiple body parts will probably be too unpleasant otherwise)

To do a while later:
Logo
Custom skin
Rework all dialogs

To do much later:
Figure out an email address
Attribution for artwork
