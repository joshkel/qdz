To do:
Test higher-speed off-hand attack
Implement focus qi + projectiles
Fully implement absorbing abilities
Better inventory screen (improvements to match my Use Talents screen - wider columns, spaces between slots?)
Order default hotkeys better
Random name generator
Right-click menu
Quick switch weapons (probably - binding qi to multiple body parts will probably be too unpleasant otherwise)
Not sure that dig speed is working right - monsters may get a free move afterwards, and displayed number of turns is always 1 greater than intended digspeed
Focus Qi should probably be instantaneous (to make it more interesting as an "oh shoot!" ability), but that messes up its duration

To do a while later:
Logo
Custom skin
Rework all dialogs

To do much later:
Figure out an email address
