To do:
Basic game mechanics: Kick, Mining Light, armor, shields
Tooltips for weapons
Starting stats
Saving projectiles doesn't work???
Add combat stats to character sheet, with explanation
AI is quite bad - if there's a row of monsters, the second one won't step around the first to double-team you
Fully implement absorbing abilities
Better inventory screen (improvements to match my Use Talents screen - wider columns, spaces between slots?)
Order default hotkeys better
Random name generator
Right-click menu
Critical hits
Left vs right hand
Quick switch weapons???
Not sure that dig speed is working right - monsters may get a free move afterwards, and displayed number of turns is always 1 greater than intended digspeed
Rename Power to Qi?
What to do about fractional HP?  It stinks to think you do enough damage to kill a foe and find out you haven't...

To do a while later:
Logo
More artwork for startup screens?
Custom skin
Rework all dialogs

To do much later:
Figure out an email address
Attribution for artwork
OGL

Game mechanics
Monster ranks??? (E.g., lower hp per con for minions / mooks, higher hp per con for elites)
Melee accuracy - based on str, ski, or a combination?  (E.g., average for most weapons, str for power weapons, ski for finesse weapons)  Kick should be based on agi; what about bash?

HP: base + 2 per level + con * 2
Power: base + 2 per level + mnd * 2
