Stats 
=====

5 stats:

* Str - damage, encumbrance.  Maybe some sort of combat maneuver bonus?
* Ski - attack.  Maybe critical hits?
* Con - health points, fortitude save.  Maybe health regeneration?
* Agi - defense, reflex save.  Maybe speed?
* Mnd - qi points, will save.  Maybe qi regeneration?

Stat magnitudes are based loosely on D20:

* An "average" character starts with 10 in each stat (50 points total).
* An "elite" character (including PCs) start with 61 points, divided as desired (averager 12 each).  (A D20 elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.  Multiplying this by 5/6, since we have one less stat, gives approximately 61.)
* Add a tier for mook / critter characters with average stats of 8?

Max stats will depend on number of techniques permitted.  See below.  For comparison, D20 has a practical stat maximum around 36 (before temporary bonuses like rage) and D&D 4e has a rough max of 30.

Tier Names:
* critter / average / elite / boss (ToME)
* terrestrial / celestial / ??? / infernal
* meek / mundane / elite or exalted or enlighened / mythical
* lead / iron / gold / jade
* provincial / ??? / imperial?
* novice / practioner / master / grand master

Levels
======

Level cap of 30.  Rationale:

* 20 is standard for D20 but feels small for a roguelike in which more frequent advancement is expected and you end as a wuxia hero.
* 50 is standard for many roguelikes (Adom, ToME, Angband), but QDZ is intended to be a shorter game.
* Is there any Oriental symbology or numerology that would work well here?  Some suggestions from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_in_Chinese_culture):
** 28 - double prosperity
** 38 - triple prosperity
** 88 - double fortune or double joy
** 99 - long-lasting or eternal
** 108 - many references in Hinduism, Buddhism, martial arts, and _Water Margin_.  See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/108_%28number%29).

Experience Curve
----------------

TO DO: How many monsters per level, and how much experience per monster, will depend in part on how many level ideas I can come up with.

Monster Levels
--------------

Should a vampire be shown as level 10 just because he appears on level 10 of the dungeon? Or should he be shown as level 1 if he's a base vampire?  Probably the former.

Should a rat on level 10 of the dungeon automatically be level 10?  Probably not.

TO DO: How should monsters level up, given that player characters' levels and stats are so dependent on absorbing techniques?  I could hand-wave it as creatures' native qi or training gives them comparable abilities.

Techniques
==========

Number of techniques known:

* [Soren Johnson says](http://gamasutra.com/view/news/193428/Seven_Deadly_Sins_of_strategy_game_design.php) that 12 is "a good rule-of-thumb for how many different options a player can keep in his or her mind before everything turns to mush."
* Multiply by 2.5 or more to allow for passive, reaction, and sustained abilities?  Additional considerations:
** Situational and out-of-combat abilities wouldn't count against the limit.
** Allowing weaker active abilities to give passive boosts to other abilities (Ã  la Diablo II's patch 1.10 skill synergy bonuses) would let me further increase this.
** Usable items and equipment would have to count against this.
* Higher-level ToME characters seem to have 25-30 abilities without it becoming *too* unmanageable.
* Is there any Oriental symbology or numerology that would work well here?  See above.

Try ~1 per level for now, for a final number around 30. TO DO: How quickly should these be learned? Is 1/level too slow? Do I need to enforce any balance of active versus passive / sustained?

Should characters start with a technique, to ease the first couple of kills?  (This may be particularly important for scholars.)

Skill Checks
============

Skill checks and attack versus defense are handled using a [logistic scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution) to provide diminishing returns (similar to a standard distribution / bell curve, but with less dropoff).  When evenly matched, +1 skill gives about a 5% increase to chance of success, with diminishing returns after that.

For attack and defense, following D20, +2 stat gives +1 to attack / defense.

Combat and Scaling
==================

Goal: 2-3 hits (for a combat-focused character) or 3-4 hits (for other characters) to defeat a monster?

[Following ToME](http://forums.te4.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=38632), hit points and damage should scale linearly with level.

Equipment
=========

Undecided.  A character's strength depending on his equipment is in genre for roguelikes (which this is) and D&D (which is an inspiration) but less in genre for wuxia and anime (which is more my setting).  If I come up with some poetic sounding vaguely martial arts names for magic equipment, it'd probably be okay.

If a player character's strength is gear-dependent, is it harder to balance against non-gear-dependent foes?
