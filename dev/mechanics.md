Stats 
=====

5 stats:

* Str
* Ski
* Con
* Agi
* Mnd

Stat magnitudes are based loosely on D20:

* An "average" character starts with 10 in each stat (50 points total).
* An "elite" character (including PCs) start with 61 points, divided as desired.  (A D20 elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.  Multiply this by 5/6, since we have one less stat, to get approximately 61.)

Levels
======

Level cap of 30.  Rationale:

* 20 is standard for D20 but feels small for a roguelike in which more frequent advancement is expected and you end as a wuxia hero.
* 50 is standard for many roguelikes (Adom, ToME, Angband), but QDZ is intended to be a shorter game.
* TO DO: Any Oriental symbology or numerology that would work well here?

Techniques
==========

Number of techniques known:

* [Soren Johnson says](http://gamasutra.com/view/news/193428/Seven_Deadly_Sins_of_strategy_game_design.php) that 12 is "a good rule-of-thumb for how many different options a player can keep in his or her mind before everything turns to mush."
* Multiply by 2.5 to allow for passive, reaction, and sustained abilities?
* TO DO: How many abilities does ToME permit before I get overwhelmed?
* TO DO: Any Oriental symbology or numerology that would work well here?

Try ~1 per level for now, for a final number around 30. TO DO: How quickly should these be learned? Is 1/level too slow? Do I need to enforce any balance of active versus passive / sustained?
