To do:
Armor should apply to all physical attacks, not just melee
As currently implemented, an off-hand attack with a staff does more damage than a dagger.  Good idea?

Consolidate references to 25% miss chance for concealment, 50% miss chance for blind-fighting
Why do I get an "offline" error message, even after uploading?
Basic game mechanics: shields
Flasher needs to not go off the edge of the screen
Critical hits
Left vs right hand
Quick switch weapons???
Not sure that dig speed is working right - monsters may get a free move afterwards, and displayed number of turns is always 1 greater than intended digspeed
What to do about fractional HP?  It stinks to think you do enough damage to kill a foe and find out you haven't...
Monsters should probably not have flawless no-light vision of player

Game mechanics
Melee accuracy - based on str, ski, or a combination?  (E.g., average for most weapons, str for power weapons, ski for finesse weapons)  Kick should be based on agi; what about bash?
Bash's knockback distance may be excessive
Starting a scholar is too tough
Fire ants are probably too tough - Burning Hand seems better than Poisoned Dart, damage on hit is probably high
