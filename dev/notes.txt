To do:
Why do I get an "offline" error message, even after uploading?
Basic game mechanics: shields
Check two-weapon combat - apparently killing a monster with the first swing doesn't stop you from trying a second swing
AI is quite bad - if there's a row of monsters, the second one won't step around the first to double-team you.  One monster will throw a dart at another's back.
Fully implement absorbing abilities
Flasher needs to not go off the edge of the screen
Random name generator
Critical hits
Left vs right hand
Quick switch weapons???
Not sure that dig speed is working right - monsters may get a free move afterwards, and displayed number of turns is always 1 greater than intended digspeed
What to do about fractional HP?  It stinks to think you do enough damage to kill a foe and find out you haven't...
Redraw FOV / light radius when light radius changes
Penalties for blind fighting (e.g., throwing a dart outside of light radius)
Inventory - encumbrance (doesn't seem to work); better inventory limits

To do a while later:
Logo
More artwork for startup screens?
Custom skin

Game mechanics
Monster ranks??? (E.g., lower hp per con for minions / mooks, higher hp per con for elites)
Melee accuracy - based on str, ski, or a combination?  (E.g., average for most weapons, str for power weapons, ski for finesse weapons)  Kick should be based on agi; what about bash?
