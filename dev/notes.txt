To do:
Why do I get an "offline" error message, even after uploading?
Basic game mechanics: shields
AI is quite bad - if there's a row of monsters, does the second one step around the first to double-team you?  One monster will throw a dart at another's back. Fire ants toss flame slash with no one in range.
Flasher needs to not go off the edge of the screen
Random name generator
Critical hits
Left vs right hand
Quick switch weapons???
Not sure that dig speed is working right - monsters may get a free move afterwards, and displayed number of turns is always 1 greater than intended digspeed
What to do about fractional HP?  It stinks to think you do enough damage to kill a foe and find out you haven't...

To do a while later:
Logo
More artwork for startup screens?
Custom skin

Game mechanics
Melee accuracy - based on str, ski, or a combination?  (E.g., average for most weapons, str for power weapons, ski for finesse weapons)  Kick should be based on agi; what about bash?
Bash's knockback distance may be excessive
Starting a scholar is too tough
Fire ants are probably too tough - Burning Hand seems better than Poisoned Dart, damage on hit is probably high
