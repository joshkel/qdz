To do:
Damage scaling, again / still - critical effects are semi-useless if no monster can survive two hits, and a peasant with a polearm can be death incarnate...
Critical effects for Off-Hand Attack, Bash, Kick, pickaxe, unarmed
Scale life regen (and qi regen?) as you gain levels
Reevaluate resistances - should the base subtraction resemble armor (with scaling)?  Should scaling handle everything and the percentage be removed?
Allow projectiles to fly farther than targeted?

Consolidate Qi module into T-Engine 1.0.5's __project_source?
Change death message for killing oneself
Split act base from act
Why do I get an "offline" error message, even after uploading?
Basic game mechanics: shields
Flasher needs to not go off the edge of the screen
Left vs right hand
Quick switch weapons???
What to do about fractional HP?  It stinks to think you do enough damage to kill a foe and find out you haven't...
Monsters should probably not have flawless no-light vision of player
"Something misses grid bug in the smoke."  What was attacking???  Verify that smoke bombs + LoS work as expected.

To do later:
More detailed descriptions of hit chances and chances of success?  Currently, it's buried in tooltips in a character sheet.
Turn orders, effects, etc.  Does Off-Hand Attack let you dodge a crit?  Should it?  Should a bat dodge a crit just because it's +25% speed?  Ideally, effects should timeout based on their creators, not their subjects.

To do a while later:
Logo
More artwork for startup screens?
Custom skin

Game mechanics
Melee accuracy - based on str, ski, or a combination?  (E.g., average for most weapons, str for power weapons, ski for finesse weapons)  Kick should be based on agi; what about bash?
Bash's knockback distance may be excessive
Starting a scholar is too tough
